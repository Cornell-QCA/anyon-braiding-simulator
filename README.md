# Anyon Braiding Simulator
Anyons are special quasiparticles that can be used for topological quantum computation (TQC). The topology of a system of anyons can be resistant to perturbations that would produce errors in other types of qubits, such that TQC is expected to be more physically robust. As anyons travel along paths through space and time, the act of “braiding” these paths can form a quantum gate operation. In particular, non-Abelian anyons demonstrate a non-commutative braiding process, which can in theory allow for any sequence of quantum gate operations with arbitrary precision. This project will simplify the construction of braid matrices (and their diagrammatic representations) by keeping track of user-applied changes to a system’s topology.

The end result will be a graphical interface that interactively records user-applied braids, displaying a visual representation of the resulting topology. The user will initialize a system of particles using a particular non-Abelian anyon model (like the Fibonacci model). The program will also convert sequences of braid operations into corresponding matrices, which describe how the state of the system changes mathematically.
